Crop Images For Beautiful Grids

Cloudinaryâ€™s image transformations give us the ability to do more than just scale images down, however. Similar to what we did with the cart image, we can crop images to fit them to a certain aspect ratio.

Our product list view uses a flexbox-based grid. Effort was made to keep our grid lines strong, but there is room for improvement here. The images used in our product grid have different **aspect ratios**, so when they are resized to the same width, they end up with different heights.
